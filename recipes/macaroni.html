    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese is the ultimate American comfort food. In this recipe, tender macaroni is coated in a rich, creamy cheese sauce with a golden crumb topping. Always satisfying and irresistibly indulgent.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons McCormick ground mustard</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons McCormick coarse ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon McCormick garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>6 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon McCormick paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Rinse under cold water. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the same pot on medium heat; sprinkle with flour, ground mustard, black pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Cook and stir until well blended, about 2 minutes. Gradually stir in milk; cook, stirring constantly, until sauce begins to thicken, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in cheese until melted and smooth. Off heat, gently stir in macaroni until coated. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Combine panko and paprika; evenly sprinkle over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
